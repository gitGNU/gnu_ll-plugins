ELVEN
=============
This is a host for LV2 plugins. It is a very simple host, all it does
is run one plugin, optionally with a GUI, as a JACK client.

To build and install, run

 ./configure
 make
 su -c 'make install'

You can pass some options to configure, e.g. --prefix=/usr to install
everything in /usr (the default is /usr/local).
