/* 
   XXX more docs here - function class etc

   This header defines data structures used by LV2 hosts and plugins that
   support the LV2 Instrument extension with URI 
   <http://ll-plugins.nongnu.org/lv2/namespace#dont-use-this-extension>.
   
   This extension adds a callback that can be used to send arbitrary
   commands to a plugin instance, and a callback that the plugin can call
   (in its implementation of the other callback) to send feedback to the host
   (and through it, to a GUI).

   A plugin that supports this extension must have a non-NULL extension_data()
   function pointer in its descriptor, that returns a pointer to an 
   LV2_CommandDescriptor, defined below, when called with the URI 
   "http://ll-plugins.nongnu.org/lv2/namespace#dont-use-this-extension". This 
   LV2_CommandDescriptor object contains a function pointer.
